 end goal is to provide a reply to the user from a query they sent you, you should consider using Kernel Memory's AskAsync method.

AskAsync uses the text model to summarize the result of a search and provide that string back to the user.



The code for this is extremely straightforward:



string question = console.Ask&lt;string&gt;("What do you want to ask?");
console.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[yellow]Asking '{question}'...[/]");

MemoryAnswer answer = await memory.AskAsync(question);

console.WriteLine(answer.Result);



    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    








This provides a text output from your LLM as you would expect:



As you might imagine, the AskAsync method takes significantly longer than SearchAsync because it effectively is performing the search as a RAG search and then using the results to chat with the underlying LLM.

If you need information about the sources cited, those are also available in the MemoryAnswer, which can be helpful for diagnostic / logging purposes or simply to let the user know what was used in answering their question - or giving them additional links to investigate.
