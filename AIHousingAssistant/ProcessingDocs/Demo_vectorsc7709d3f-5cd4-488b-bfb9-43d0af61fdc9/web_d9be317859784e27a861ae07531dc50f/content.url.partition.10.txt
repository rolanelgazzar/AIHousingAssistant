. This is not a production-level solution, but is fine for quick demonstrations on low volumes of data. For larger-scale scenarios or production usage you would use a dedicated vector storage solution and connect it to Kernel Memory when building your IKernelMemory instance.

Also note the use of AnsiConsole. This is part of Spectre.Console, a library I frequently use alongside .NET console apps for enhanced input and output capabilities. We'll see more of this later.


  
  
  Indexing Documents and Web Scraping with Kernel Memory


With our Kernel Memory instance set up and running an empty vector store, we should ingest some data before we continue on.

Kernel Memory supports importing data in the following formats:


Raw strings
Web pages via web scraping
Documents in a supported format (PDF, Images, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Markdown, text files, and JSON)


The API for importing each of these sources is exceptionally simple as well:



// Index documents and web content
console.MarkupLine("[yellow]Importing documents...[/]");

await memory.ImportTextAsync("KernelMemory allows you to import web pages, documents, and text");
await memory.ImportTextAsync("KernelMemory supports PDF, md, txt, docx, pptx, xlsx, and other formats", "Doc-Id");

await memory.ImportDocumentAsync("Facts.txt", "Repository-Facts");

await memory.ImportWebPageAsync("https://LeadingEDJE.
